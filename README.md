# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction-using-Pytorch-and-Plotly

Predicting the mobile price range based on specification is a major problem for companies. The purpose of this report is to estimate the price of new phones. In such a competitive environment, we cannot simply assume things. The focus of this report is to analyse relation between different features of the phone like RAM size, clock speed, Mobile weights etc and accordingly predict the mobile price range. The dataset used for this research is taken from various sales data and it can be downloaded from Kaggle. Pytorch is used to create a model that can help in predicting the price range of new mobile phones launched by a company. Plotly is used to plot graphs which provides various insights into the data.
